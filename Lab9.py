    (use “= range(10,101,10))
•	Two string variables called “upper” and “lower” and assign the values of the
    uppercase letters to upper and the lowercase letters to lower
    (use “= string.uppercase” for Python versions prior to 3.5
    and “= string.ascii_uppercase” for version 3.5)
•	A tuple called “mytuple” with the numbers, upper, and lower as the items.
Output each of the data types created.
Output only the lowercase letters using “mytuple” data type and negative index.
Try adding a line to change any of the items in “mytuple.”
